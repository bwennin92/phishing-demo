      <p>
        Hello! I'm Brandon, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for protecting digital assets and enhancing security protocols. I hold a Google Cybersecurity Certificate and am CompTIA Security+ certified. My journey in cybersecurity has equipped me with skills in SIEM, incident response, network security, and threat intelligence.
        I have hands-on experience with vulnerability assessments and am currently expanding my knowledge through Hack The Box's SOC Analyst modules. I also have a background in web development, particularly with React, which allows me to create secure and efficient applications. My goal is to leverage my skills to contribute to a safer digital world.
