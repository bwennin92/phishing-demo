# Phishing Detection Demo

This interactive React app is designed to **teach users how to spot phishing emails** and elevate their awareness of common phishing scams. The demo presents a series of realistic email examples, challenging users to decide if each is "Phishing" or "Safe." 

## Purpose

Phishing is one of the most common and dangerous forms of cyber attack. This demo helps users:
- **Recognize red flags** in suspicious emails
- **Practice identifying phishing attempts** in a safe environment
- **Learn the tactics** that attackers use to trick people

## How It Works

- You will be shown 5 randomly selected email examples.
- For each, choose whether you think it is "Phishing" or "Safe."
- Immediate feedback is provided for each answer, including an explanation.
- If you answer all correctly, you'll be congratulated with a confetti animation!
- You can reset and try again for more practice with different questions.
